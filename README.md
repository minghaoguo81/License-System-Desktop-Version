This is a C++ implementation of a licensing system developed initially at work, which includes functionality for hardware identification, AES encryption and decryption, and MD5 hashing. 
For the actual deployment on the client side, I develope a backend system using Spring Boot and MySQL allowing real-time validation with the license information stored at database in the company server side.
