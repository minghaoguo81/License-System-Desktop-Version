This is a C++ implementation of a licensing system developed initially at work, which includes functionality for hardware identification, AES encryption and decryption, and MD5 hashing. 
Later, it was upgraded into a backend system using Spring Boot and MySQL allowing real-time validation with the license information stored at database in the company server side for deployment. 
I put the inital desktop version here since this is not being used by the client or the company.
